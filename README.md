# 🚀 Decentralized Grant Funding Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary way to manage grant funding on the blockchain! This project automates the disbursement of funds based on verifiable milestones, solving real-world issues like opacity, delays, and mismanagement in traditional grant systems. Using the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, it ensures transparency, trustless execution, and efficient allocation of resources for projects in research, development, or social impact.

Traditional grant funding often suffers from bureaucratic hurdles, subjective evaluations, and risks of fund misuse. This Web3 solution leverages smart contracts to escrow funds, track progress via milestones, and release payments automatically upon verification, empowering funders and grantees with immutable records and reduced intermediaries.

## ✨ Features

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Funders**  
- Deposit funds into the escrow contract for a specific proposal.  
- Vote on proposals using the governance token or direct participation.  
- Monitor progress and receive refunds if milestones fail.  

**For Grantees**  
- Submit a proposal with milestones, timelines, and funding requests.  
- Provide proof of completion (e.g., hashes, links, or oracle data) for each milestone.  
- Receive automatic disbursements upon verification.  

**For Verifiers/Community**  
- Review and vote on milestone completions.  
- Initiate disputes if evidence is insufficient.  
- Access full audit trails via the blockchain explorer.  

The system uses a modular architecture with 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts to handle different aspects, ensuring scalability and security. Proposals are hashed for uniqueness, and all actions are timestamped immutably on Stacks.
